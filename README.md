Python scripts

fizzbuzz.py


    This script is the fizzbuzz test. In range (1, 1000) if a number is modular 3 it outputs Fizz, 
    if a number is modular 5 it outputs Buzz, and if a number is both modular 3 and 5 it outputs Fizz Buzz.
    
    
    
scribble_cheat.py

    This is a scrabble cheat that I wrote but instead of using it for scrabble, I use it for scribble. When you 
    enter in your 7 letters it shows you all the word from the internal dictionary in Ubuntu. Along with showing
    you the words it also calculates how much the word is worth. I have not implemented
    the use of the blank letters yet
